Software Development Using Java


## COURSE DESCRIPTION
This training prepares participants to become Java application developers ready for the professional world.
It covers topics that are essential to the mission, including professional development skills, financial and market
concepts, ITIL principles and best practices, and application development using Java and principles of OOP.
By the end of this training, participants will be able to design and build an application in Java, as well as
implement the necessary steps to deploy, monitor, and support the application.
## LEARNING OUTCOMES
By the end of this course, participants will be able to:
-  Demonstrate professionalism, including communication skills and personal interactions.
-  Explain market and financial concepts at a high level.
-  Design, develop, and test a Java application.
-  Demonstrate understanding of monitoring, supporting, and troubleshooting and how it ties into good
development processes.
-  Use git to manage the source code for a project.
-  Use appropriate of code layout, object names, and comments to make code more understandable to
other developers.
-  Use Maven to manage outside libraries used in a project.
-  Use dependency injection in the construction of an application and explain the advantages of loosely
coupled code, and the MVC pattern.
-  Build applications using the MVC pattern.
-  Incorporate I/O operations in an application to store and retrieve data used by the application.
-  Use appropriate data type when developing an application as well as convert data types when necessary.
-  Create an application that has a service layer with business logic, lambdas and streams in at least part of
the DAO, incorporates unit tests for DAOs and the service layer in an application, that validates user input
and properly handles all exceptions.
-  Explain the foundational elements of the Java language, object-oriented design, and testing
methodology.
-  Create a full-stack application that includes a database and server-side programming on the back end
with Web content and client-side scripting on the front end.
-  Create and manage a relational database using SQL.
-  Use an ERD to design a database to meet the requirements of second normal form (2NF).
-  Demonstrate the use of a layered MVC architecture with View, Controller, Service Layer, and DAO and
DTO components.
-  Use JDBC Templates with DAO components to interact with a database.
-  Create a full test suite for the Service Layer and DAOs in an application.
-  Incorporate server-side programming in a web app using Spring MVC.
